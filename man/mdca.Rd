\title{Multiple distinctive collexeme analysis (MDCA)}
\usage{
mdca(df = NULL, cxn_var = "synonyms", coll_var = "metaphors",
  already_count_table = FALSE, assocstr_digits = 3L, correct_holm = TRUE,
  concise_output = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{the data frame for the thesis (\code{phd_data_metaphor}) included in the package.}

\item{cxn_var}{character strings for the column name for the \code{constructions} variable, in this case, the "\code{synonyms}" column.}

\item{coll_var}{character strings for the column name for the \code{collocates} variable, in this case, the "\code{metaphors}" column.}

\item{already_count_table}{logical; the default is \code{FALSE} indicating \code{mdca} takes raw input data frame for observation-per-row format as in the case of \code{phd_data_metaphor}.
When it is \code{TRUE}, it expects tidy co-occurrence count between values of \code{var_cxn} and \code{var_coll} with three columns:
\tabular{rrr}{
 synonyms \tab metaphors \tab n\cr
     kesenangan \tab happiness is a possessable object \tab 182\cr
     kebahagiaan \tab happiness is a possessable object \tab 181\cr
     ... \tab ... \tab ...
}}

\item{assocstr_digits}{integer for the floating points/digits of the \emph{Association Strength}. The default is \code{3L}.}

\item{correct_holm}{logical; the default is \code{TRUE} for performing Holm's correction method of the \emph{p}-value (cf. Gries, 2009, p. 249).}

\item{concise_output}{logical; if \code{TRUE} (the default), \code{mdca} outputs the following columns:
    \itemize{
        \item \code{metaphors}
        \item \code{synonyms}
        \item \code{n} (for the \emph{observed} co-occurrence frequency between \code{metaphors} and the \code{synonyms}).
        \item \code{exp} (for the \emph{expected} co-occurrence frequency between \code{metaphors} and the \code{synonyms}).
        \item \code{p_binomial} (the one-tailed \emph{p}-value of the \emph{Binomial Test}).
        \item \code{assocstr} (the log10 transformed values of the \emph{p}-value of the \emph{Binomial Test}. The \code{assocstr} values are \emph{positive} when \code{n} is higher than the \code{exp} frequency, and they are \emph{negative} when otherwise.).
        \item \code{p_holm} (when \code{correct_holm} is \code{TRUE})
        \item \code{dec} (significance decision after Holm's correction) (when \code{correct_holm} is \code{TRUE})
    }

If \code{concise_output} is \code{FALSE}, \code{mdca} returns the total tokens in the data, total frequency of each collexeme/collocate, total frequency of each construction, the sum of absolute deviation of the collexeme/collocate, the construction name, showing the largest deviation from the expected, co-occurrence frequency with the collexeme, expected probability of the co-occurrence, and the direction of the deviation from the expected frequency (i.e., whether a collexeme is attracted or repelled by a construction).}

\description{
Function to perform \emph{Multiple Distinctive Collexeme Analysis} (MDCA) in Rajeg's (2018) Chapter 7.
}
\details{
The \code{mdca} function is built on top of the core members of the \code{tidyverse} suit of packages.
    The computation of the \emph{Association Strength} is based on the \code{\link[stats]{binom.test}} function (cf. Hilpert, 2006). The computation of the corrected \emph{p}-value of the one-tailed Binomial Test with Holm's method is performed using \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}.

    There is a well-known interactive R script to perform MDCA by Stefan Th. Gries that is called \href{http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/stgries/teaching/groningen/index.html}{\emph{Coll.analysis 3.5}} (Gries, 2014). The script includes the other codes to compute the family of methods of \emph{Collostructional Analyses}. The \code{mdca} function in happyr aims to achieve the same analytical goal as that in \emph{Coll.analysis 3.5}, but is designed differently in terms of its usage and the internal codes, as it is based on the \href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{tidyverse}.

    \code{mdca} allows users to have input and output data frame directly in the R environment, primarily enabling them to write interactive document in R Markdown in relation to MDCA. Moreover, happyr provides two functions dedicated to handle the output of \code{mdca} to retrieve the \emph{distinctive/attracted} and \emph{repelled} collexemes/collocates for a given construction. In contrast, Stefan Gries' script has two options to either print the output into (i) terminal or (ii) into external plain text, which requires post-processing of the results, mostly on a spreadsheet.
